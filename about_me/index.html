Hello! My name is Shane, I currently reside in Johannesburg South Africa. I am persuing my Barchelor's in Applied Technology.One of the major reasons why I chose this course is because of the rate at which every sector  is becoming more technological. Most manual systems are being replaced by automated ones. This then places a high demand on technological advancements.
</p>
<p>Another thing that I have learnt about myself is that I love customizing a lot of things to suit my needs.I do admit that sometimes i do go over-board. As a result it feels too much to place that burden on someone else's shoulders. Learning more about Web Development will gift me with this ability to build what I want, however I want it without feeling guilty.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently working as a nursing assistant. I love this as I get a sense of satisfaction from providing aid to vulnerable individuals who cannot exactly render the same for themselves.

  During my spare time I love having a good read. That would be my number 1 to go to hobby.Gardening and Art(painting and drawing) come next. When it comes to animals, I have learnt to be at peace with dogs.Ohh, I am terrified of cats.
